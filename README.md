# YouTube API Search App

Practice makes perfect! So to keep my AJAX skills sharp, working with a well-documented, well-maintained API like YouTube's made sense.

## Usage

Just clone the repo and open the **index.html** file!

## Limitations

* Currently, only 5 results load and there is no 'next page' functionality. Loading more videos is a feature that is high on my to-do list!
* The videos open in a separate tab. I would love to have the videos load at container width, but I haven't found the magic words to make sizing YouTube embeds with CSS work.

## Development Goals

I don't really intend to reinvent the wheel, so this project will likely be eternally back-burnered. I have some other API projects in the works though!
